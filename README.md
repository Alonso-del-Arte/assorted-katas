# Assorted Katas

An assortment of katas.

## Calculators

Most of the tests for NTFC (Number Theoretic Functions Calculator) are failing.

## Fractions

Almost all of the tests for the Fraction class are failing. If you can get those tests to pass, the Egyptian Fraction Viewer program should become functional.

## Swing Auxiliary

These are not katas per se, but supplement Java AWT/Swing for the Egyptian Fraction Viewer program in the Fractions kata.
